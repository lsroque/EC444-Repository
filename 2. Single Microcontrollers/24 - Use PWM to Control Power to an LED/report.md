## Summary

In this skill, we were required to create a circuit that would use the PWM output to drive an LED at different intensity levels between 0 and 9. In my program, I created a console in which the user can change the value of the intensity of the LED. Once this number between 0 to 9 is pressed, the LED changes to that intensity level and stays in that step for 250ms (shines at that intensity for 250ms) and then turns off. After, the user needs to press another number between 0 and 9 for another LED to turn on at a specific intensity for a 250ms interval.
