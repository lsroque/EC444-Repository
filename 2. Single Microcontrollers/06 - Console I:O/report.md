## Summary
In this skill, we were required to interact with the console. I was able to use the UART driver to communicate from my PC with the ESP32. Using a program, the user is able to input a set of keys to switch between 3 different modes. The user is able to switch modes upon key input 's,' toggle the LED upon key input 't,' echo an input when 2 or more characters are input by the user, and echo a decimal number input as a hexadecimal.

## Sketches and Photos
Shown below is the on board LED toggled on/off based on key input 't.' <br />
