# Code Readme

In the program skill11.c, I was able to use 3 different tasks to create a pushbutton, timer, and alphanumeric display functions. First, I used the pushbutton function from skill10 in this program. Next, I used the timer function (from Github repository provided) in order to user timer interrupts instead of delay functions. Last, I used the alphanumeric display code from skill10, and modified it to use conditional if statements to count up and wrap modulo 100.
