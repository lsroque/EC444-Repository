# Code Readme

In skill30.c, I used MCPWM code to bring up the motors and use the H Driver. I define my left motor as motor 1 and right motor as motor 2. I set up different functions that move the car forward, backward, right, left, and one that stops the car. I set up a duty cycle of 90% for all of the functions to showcase how strong the PWM can be.
