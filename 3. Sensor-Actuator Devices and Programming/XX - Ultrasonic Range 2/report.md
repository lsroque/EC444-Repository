## Summary
In this skill, I used the ultrasonic range sensor and was able to use RMT (Remote Control) to measure pulse and pulse duration. This was then converted to centimeters and output on the terminal.


** Due to wiring issues with the LIDAR v4, I ended up using the ultrasonic range sensor to obtain distance in cm.
