# Code Readme

In this folder I have i2c_display.c and skill12.c. The i2c_display.c code simply contains all of the ASCII characters from the adafruit Github repository and converts them into a string to be shown on the alphanumeric display. Then, I was able to place in the i2c functions into the main function of skill12. Then averaged over 1000ms, the sprintf function was used to display the values received from the battery onto the alphanumeric display.
