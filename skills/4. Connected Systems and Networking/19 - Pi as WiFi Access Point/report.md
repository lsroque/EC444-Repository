## Summary

The purpose of this still was to install the correct software to enable the Pi Zero W â€“Wireless to operate as a WiFi Router. In this way, the raspberry pi will be able to host an access piinr and create a "subnet" or network for the ESP later on. The steps to complete this skill were as follows: (1) enable "ethernet gadget," (2) enable "connection sharing", and (3) configure the pi as a wireless access point.

In this skill we were required to set out channel assignments based on our team number. I am a part of team 15, and set up the channel to Channel 11.
