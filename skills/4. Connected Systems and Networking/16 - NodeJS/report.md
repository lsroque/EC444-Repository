## Summary
In this skill we we required to download node.js, install node.js and npm, complete the modules, and create a node.js program that would read data from the serial port and print sensor data to console from the node program. In the node.js program, I was able to specify from what we were reading from, the baud rate at which data was read, and was able to print out new data on a new line every 2 seconds. The out of the node module is shown below.
