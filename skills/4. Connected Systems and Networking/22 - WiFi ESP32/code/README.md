# Code Readme

In skill 22, we were required to connect the ESP-32 to WiFi. When connecting my ESP to WiFi, I needed to make sure that that WiFi I connected to used WPA2, as required from the sample code. I changed my router's ssid and password in this sample code. I also needed to make sure that my ESP was connected to the correct channel (either 1, 6, 11). Last, I made sure I connected to the correct bandwidth of WiFi, as my ESP32 was only able to connect to 2.4 GHZ WiFi.
