## Summary
In this team skill, we were required to get a free Dynamic DNS account (on noip.com), set up the router to connect to the DDNS service using DDClient, and set up the RPi on my laptop as a webserver using node.js. Then, this is demonstrated by accessing the webserver from external port 3333.
