## Summary
In this skill we were required to download the lastest firmware for the Raspberry Pi Zero W, format an SD Card, boot the pi up (while configuring wifi), and use a node.js server to demonstrate that node.js works.

I ran into a couple of issues while configuring the Raspberry Pi, however, once I received the new Raspberry Pi I was able to configure the wifi, ssh, and finally run node.js. Below are some of the steps I took as required by the skill.
