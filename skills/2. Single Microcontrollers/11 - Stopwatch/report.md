## Summary
The purpose of this skill is to make a stopwatch that uses a pushbutton, alphanumeric display, and timer function. Upon the button press, the timer should start counting up in seconds. Upon an additional button press, the timer resets at zero. The alphanumeric display indicates the current count in seconds and wraps modulo 100.

** Note: My button function is not working. However, the timer count up and alphanumeric display work as required of the skill.
