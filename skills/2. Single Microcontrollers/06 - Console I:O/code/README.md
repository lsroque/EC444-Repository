# Code Readme

In this program, skill06.c, I was able to use a switch case in order to get my PC to communicate with the ESP32. I used 3 cases in this program. 
In case 1, the onboard LED toggled with input 't.' In case 2, the console takes in 2 or more characters and echos the input. 
In case 3, a decimal number input is converted to a hexadecimal. In order to switch between the different modes, or cases, the user
would use key input 's.'

The use of string arrays and the function atoi, in changing strings to integers were extremely helpful in this code. I used two sources to help me out with the string arrays and atoi.
