# Code Readme

The goal of the code 'skill07.c' is to toggle GPIO signals on/off using a set
of LEDs on an ESP32 board. Using the blink-type program to build off of, I
wrote a program that would count up, and wrap, in binary on the set of 4 LEDs.

Help on converting a decimal number to a binary number was received from:
