## Summary
In this skill, we were required to toggle the GPIO signals on/off in order to
control a set of LEDs. We were required to use our circuitry skills in order to
wire up 4 LEDs on the breadboard using resistors and the ESP32 as a power source.
Then, using a blink-type program, we counted up, and wrapped, in binary the set
of 4 LEDs.
