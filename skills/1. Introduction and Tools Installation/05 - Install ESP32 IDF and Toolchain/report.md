## Summary
In this skill we were required to install the USB driver, prerequisites, download the ESP-IDF from GitHub, and set up the tools and proper environment in order to work with the ESP32 board. In order to verify that my toolchain worked, I used the 'Hello World' example downloaded from GitHub. I was able to figure out my ESP32's serial code and get 'Hello World' to flash.

Afterwards, I tried the process out again using the downloaded 'Blink' example from GitHub. In order to do so, I changed the constant in Blink.c to '13.' Then once compiled and monitored, the terminal indicated when the LED was on/off and the Red LED would blink 1 second at a time on the ESP32 board.
