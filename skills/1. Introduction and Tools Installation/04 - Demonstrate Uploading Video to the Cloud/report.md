## Summary
This skill required us to record a simple video (indicating name, class year, and major), store it, and upload it (on youtube, vimeo, google drive, etc.). Afterwards, we were to embed the video and provide a link in our report.md file.

This video must not be longer than 120 seconds, 16x9 landscape format, and editing is allowed. I have uploaded my video using youtube.
