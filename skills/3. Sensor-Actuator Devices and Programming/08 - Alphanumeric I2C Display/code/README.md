# Code Readme

In this program, skill08.c, the user is able to input 4 ASCII characters in the console to be displayed on the alphanumeric display.  <br/>
 <br/>
I built off of the example code provided in the github repo:  <br/>
https://github.com/BU-EC444/code-examples/tree/master/i2c-display <br/>
 <br/>
 
Then I added the display of ASCII characters from adafruit's github repo: <br/>
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_LED_Backpack/blob/master/Adafruit_LEDBackpack.cpp <br/>
<br/> In order to write up the characters, the use of the UART driver was necessary to connect the console to the I2C bus on the alphanumeric display.
