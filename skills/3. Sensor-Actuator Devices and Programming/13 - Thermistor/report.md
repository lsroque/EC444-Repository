## Summary
In this skill we were required to create a voltage divider for the thermistor, wire it up to an ADC input, and read the data from the console to be sampled every 2 seconds. In my voltage divider, I used two 10K ohm resistors to stay within the required range and connected to ADC pin 34. Below, the terminal output is shown.
