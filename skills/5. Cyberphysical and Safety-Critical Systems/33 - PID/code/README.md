# Code Readme

In skill33.c, a PID algorithm is implemented. This PID code is modeled after the design pattern for PID control. In this program, Kd and Ki are both set to 0 , Kp to 1, and the dt delay is set to 100ms. Moreover, LED GPIOs are defined in order to use the conditional statements to turn on a particular LED on when the error is either less than, equal to, or greater than 0.
