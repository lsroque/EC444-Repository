# Code Readme

In this skill, I modified skill 14's print statement to only print out the needed distance value (ultrasonic_distance.c). Then, I was able to create a node.js file that read from the serial port and printed the sensors data to the console from the node program. In the node.js file, I used a parser to read the data line by line and then wrote the data to the console.
