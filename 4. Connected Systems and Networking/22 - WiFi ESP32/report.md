## Summary

In this skill we were required to establish the ESP32 to the WiFi LAN (Wireless Local Area Network). In order to do this, we used the WiFi station example from the ESP32 files given. In this example, I changed the ssid and password to that of my home networks router, flashed the ESP, and then checked the router page to check the status of the ESP32. It is important to note that the ESP is only able to successfuly connect to 2.4GHz band wifi in my case. In the images we can see that the ESP connection was successful as we see it's IP address in the terminal output and on the Device List of my home router's Verizon Fios network.
